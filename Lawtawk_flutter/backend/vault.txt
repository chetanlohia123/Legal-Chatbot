25, infra ; the C opyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957), s . 19; the Carriers Act, 1865 (3 of 1865) ss.6 and 7; the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) , ss.12, 30, 46 and 109.3.See the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875).14 Explanation .—It is immaterial whether the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is or is not in force in the place where the coercion is employed.Illustration A, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal intimidat ion under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ).A afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Calcutta.A has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and although section 506 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) was not in force at the time when or place where the act was done.
1[16.“Undue influence ” defined .—(1) A contract is said to be induced by “undue influence ” where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an u nfair advantage over the other. (2) In particular and without prejudice to the gene rality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position t o dominate the will of another — (a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other , or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or (b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or bodily distress.
(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with him, and the t ransaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a position to dominate the will of the other. Nothing in this s ub-section shall affe ct the provisions of section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872 ).Illustrations (a) A having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B ’s coming of age obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond from B for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the adva nce.A employs undue influence.(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B ’s influence over him as his medical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for his professional servi ces.B employs undue influence.

Explanation .—Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the p erson keeping silence to speak3, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech.1.Subs.by Act 6 of 1899, s.2 , for the original s.16.2.Cf.s.
238, infra . 3.See s.143, infra .15 Illustrations (a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound.A says nothing to B about the horse ’s unsou ndness.This is not fraud in A.(b) B is A ’s daughter and has just come of age.Here, the relation between the parties would make it A ’s duty to tell B if the horse is unsound.(c) B says to A —“If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound.” A says nothing.Here, A ’s silence is equivale nt to speech.(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract.A has private information of a change in prices which would affect B ’s willingness to proceed with the contra ct.A is not bound to inform B .18.
“Misrepresentation ” defined .—“Misrepresentation ” means and includes — (1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, t hough he believes it to be true; (2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person committing it, or any one claiming under him; by misleading another to his pr ejudice , or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him; (3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement , to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which i s the subject of the agreement. 19.Voidability of a greements without free consent .—When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion,1*** fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.
A party to a contract whose cons ent was caused by fraud or mis represen tation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations made had been true. Exception .—If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the meaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence .Explanation .—A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable.Illustrations (a) A, intending to dece ive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s factory, and thereby induces B to buy the factory.The contract is voidable at the option of B.
(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that, five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s factory. B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made.After thi s B buys the factory.The contract is not voidable on account of A ’s misrepresent ation.(c) A fraudulently informs B that A ’s estate is free from in cumbrance.B thereupon buys the estate.The estate is subject to a mortgage.B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage d ebt redeemed.(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore from A.Through A ’s ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under -value.The contract is voidable at the opt ion of A.
(e) A is en titled to succeed to an estate at the death of B ; B dies: C, having received intelligence of B ’s death, preven ts the intelligence reaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate. The sale is voidable at the optio n of A.2[19A.Power to set aside contra ct induced by undue influence .—When consent to an agreement is caused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the par ty whose consent was so caused.1.The words “undue influence” rep.by Act 6 of 1899, s.3.2.Ins.by Act 6 of 1899, s.3.16 Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the Court may seem just.Illustrations (a) A’s son has forged B ’s name to a promissory note.B under threat of prosecuting A ’s son, obtains a bond from A for the amount of the forged note.If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside.
(b) A, a money -lender, advances Rs. 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for Rs.200 with interest at 6 per cent.per month.Th e Court may set the bond aside, ordering B to repay the Rs.100 with s uch interest as may seem just.] 20.Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact .—Where both the parties to an agreement a re under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the ag reement, the agreement is void.Explanation .—An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject -matter of the agreement , is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.Illustrations (a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England to Bombay.It turns out that, before the day of the bargain, the ship conveying the cargo had been cast away and the goods lost.Neither party wa s aware of th e these facts.The agreement is void.(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse.
It turns out that the ho rse was dead at the time of the bargain, though neither party was aware of the fact. The a greement is void.(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C.B was dead at the time of the agreement, but both parties were ignorant of the fact.The agreement is void.21.Effect of mist akes as to law .—A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mist ake as to any law in force in 1[India]; but a mistak e as to a law not in force in 1[India] has the sa me effect as a mistake of fact.2* * * * * Illustration A and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian Law of Limitation : the contract is not voidable.3* * * * * 22.Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter of fact .—A contract is not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact.23.

Here B ’s prom ise to pay the sum of 10,000 rupees is the consideration for A ’s promise to sell the house, and A ’s promise to sell the house is the consideration for B ’s promise to pay the 10,000 rupees. These are lawful considerations.(b) A promises to pay B 1,000 rupe es at the end of six months, if C, who owes that sum to B, fails to pay it.B promises to grant time to C accordingly.Here, the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party , and they are lawful considerations.(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if it is wrecked on a certain voyage.Here , A’s promise is the consideration for B ’s payment and B ’s payment is the consideration for A ’s promise and t hese are lawful con siderations.(d) A promises to maintain B ’s child , and B promises to pay A 1,000 rupees yearly for the purpose.Here , the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party.
They are lawful considerations. (e) A, B and C enter in to an agreement for the division am ong them of gains acquired or to be acquired, by them by fraud.The agreement is v oid, as its object is unlawful.(f) A promises to obtain for B an em ployment in the public service and B promises to pay 1,000 rupees to A.The agreement is void, as the co nsideration for it is unlawful.(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease of land belonging to his principal.The agreement between A and B is void , as it implies a fraud by conce alment, by A, on his principal.(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery, and B promises to restore the value of the things taken.The agreement is v oid, as its object is u nlawful.(i) A’s estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legislature, by which the defaulter is prohibited from purchasing the estate.
B, upon an understanding with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate to A upon receiving from him the price which B has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the transaction, in effect , a purchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the law.(j) A, who is B ’s mukhtar, promises to exercise his in fluence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay 1,000 rupees to A.The agreement is voi d, because it is immoral.(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage.The agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) .Void agreements 24.Agreement s void, if consideration s and objects unlawful in part .—If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object, is u nlawful, the agreement is void.
Illustration A promises to superintend, on behalf of B, a legal manufacture of indigo, and an illegal traffic in other articles. B promises to pay to A a salary of 10,000 rupees a yea r.The agreement is void, the object of A ’s promise, and the consideration for B ’s promise, being in part unlawful.25.

18 (3) it is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might hav e enforced payment but for the l aw for the limitation of suits. In any of these cases, such an agree ment is a contract.Explanation 1.—Nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between the donor and do nee, of any gift actually made.Explanation 2.—An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inade quate ; but the inadequacy of the consideration may be taken into account by the Court in determining the question whether the consent of the promisor was freely given.Illustrations (a) A promises, for no consideration, to give to B Rs.1 ,000.This is a void agreement.(b) A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son, B, Rs.1,000.

Illustrations (a) A promises to pay B a sum of money.A may perform this promise, either by personally paying the money to B or by causing it to be paid to B by another ; and, if A dies before the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the promise, or empl oy some proper person to do so.(b) A promises to paint a picture for B.A must p erform this promise personally.41.Effect of accepting performance from third pers on.—When a promisee accepts performance of the promise from a third person, he cannot afterwards e nforce it against the promisor.42.

Illustration A undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day . A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for the purpose of receiving it, and must d eliver it to him at such place.50.Performance in manner or at time prescr ibed or sanctioned by promisee .—The performance of any promise may be made in any manner , or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions.Illustrations (a) B owes A 2,000 rupees.A desires B to pay the amount to A ’s account with C, a banker.B, who also banks with C, orders the amount to be transferred from his account to A ’s credit, and this is done by C.Afterwards, and before A knows of the transfer, C fails.There has been a good payment by B .(b) A and B are mutually indebted.A and B settle an account by setting off one item against another, and B pays A the balance found to be due from him upon such settlement.This amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which they ow ed to each other.
(c) A owes B 2,000 rupees. B accepts some of A ’s goods in reduction of the debt.The delivery of go ods operates as a pa rt payment.(d) A desires B, who owes him Rs.100, to send him a note for Rs.100 by post.The debt is discharged as soon as B puts into the post a letter containin g the note duly addressed to A.Performance of reciprocal promises 51.Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promise e ready and willing to perform .—When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promi se.Illustrations (a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B t o be paid for by B on delivery.A need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery.B need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment .

(b)A hires B ’s ship to go to Bombay, and there take on board, on the first of January , a cargo , which A is to provide, and to bring it to Calcutta, the freight to be paid when earned.B ’s ship does not go to Bombay, but A has opportunities of procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship.A avails himself of those opportunities, but is put to trou ble and expense in doing so.A is entitled to receive compensation from B in respe ct of such trouble and expense.(c)A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of rice, no time being fixed for delivery.A afterwards informs B that he will not ac cept the rice if tendered to him.
B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the amount, if any, by which the contract price exceeds that which B can obtain for the rice at the time when A inform s B that he will not accept it. (d) A contracts to buy B ’s ship for 60,000 rupees, but breaks his promise.A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the excess, if any, of the contract price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time of the breach of promise.(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of jute to Mirzapur, for sale at that place, starting on a specified day.The boat, owing to some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, whereby the arrival of the cargo at Mirza pur is delayed beyond the tim e when it would have arrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract.After that date, and before the arrival of the cargo, the price of jute falls.
The measure of the compensation payable to B by A is the difference betwee n the price which B coul d have obtained for the cargo at Mirzapur at the time when it would have arrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it actually arrived. (f) A contracts to repair B ’s house in a certain manner, and receives payment in advance .A repairs the house, but not according to contract.B is entitled to recover from A the cost of making the r epairs conform to the contract.(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from the first of January, for a certain price.Freights rise, an d, on the first of January, the hire obtainable for the ship is higher than the contract price.A breaks his promise.He must pay to B, by way o f compensation, a sum equal to the difference between the contract price and the price for which B could hire a similar ship for a year on and from the first of January.
(h) A contracts to supply B with a certain quantity of iron at a fixed price, being a higher price than that for which A could procure and deliver the iron. B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron.B must pay to A, by way of compensation, the differen ce between the contract price of the iron and the sum for which A could have obtained and delivered it.(i) A delivers to B, a common carrier, a machine, to be conveyed, without delay, to A ’s mill informing B that his mill is stopped for want of the machine.B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A, in consequence, loses a profitable contract with the Government.A is entitled to receive from B, by way of compensation, the average amount of profit which would have b een made by the working of the mill during the time that delivery of it was delayed, but not the loss sustained through the l oss of the Government contract.
(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1,000 tons of iron at 100 rupees a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, contracts with C for the pur chase of 1,000 tons of iron at 80 rupees a ton, telling C that he does so for the purpose of performing his contract with B. C fails to perform his contract with A, who cannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract.C must pay to A 20,000 rupees, being the profit which A would have made by the perf ormance of his contract with B.(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a specified price, a certain piece of machinery.
A does not deliver the piece of machinery at the time specified, and in consequence of this, B is obliged to procure another at a high er price than that which he was to have paid to A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made with a third person at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been then communicated to A), and is compelled to make compensation for breach of that contract. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the differ ence between the contract price of the p iece of machi nery and the sum paid by B for another, but not the sum paid by B to the third person by way of compensation.(l)A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the first of January, in order that B may give possession of it at th at time to C, to wh om B has contracted to let it.A is informed of the contract between B and C.
A builds the house so badly that, before the first of January, it falls down and has to be re -built by B, who, in consequence, loses the rent which he was to have received from C , and is obliged to make compensation to C for the breach of his contract. A must make compensation to B for the cost of rebuilding the house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C.(m)A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular quality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it to C with a similar warranty.The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes liable to pay C a sum of money by way of compensation.B is entitled to be reimbursed this sum by A.31 (n)A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified.A does not pay the money on that day , B, in consequence of not receiving the money on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined.
A is not liable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pa y, together with interest up to the day of payment. (o)A contracts to deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B on the first of January, at a certain pr ice.B afterwards, before the first of January, contracts to sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market price of the first of January.A breaks hi s promise.In estimating the compensation payable by A to B, the market price of the first of January, and not the profit which would have arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken into account.(p)A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on a fixed day.A knows nothing of B ’s mode of conducting his business.A breaks his promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill.A is not responsible to B for the loss caused to B by the closing of the mill.
(q)A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the first of January, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture in to caps of a particular kind, for which there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after the appointed tim e, and too late to be used that year in making caps.B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the diff erence between the contract price of the cloth and its market price at the time of delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain by making caps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in making p reparation for the manufacture.(r)A, a ship -owner, c ontracts with B to convey him from Calcutta to Sydney in A ’s ship, sailing on the first of January, and B pays to A, by way of deposit, one -half of his passage -money.
The ship does not sail on the first of January, and B, after being in consequence detained in Calcutta for some time and thereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, in consequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money. A is l iable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the expense to which he is put by his detention in Calcutta, and the excess, if any, of the passage -money paid for the second ship over that agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money which B lost by arriving in Sydney too late.74.

125.Rights of indemnity -holder wh en sued .—The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is entitle d to recover from the promisor — (1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which the promise to indemnify ap plies; (2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if , in bringing or defending it, he did not contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as it would have been prudent for him to act in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend the suit; (3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such sui t, if the compromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been prudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authori zed him to compromise the suit. 126.
“Contract of guarantee ”, “surety ”, “principal debtor ” and “creditor ”.—A “contract of guarantee” is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his default. The person who gives the guarantee is called the “surety ”; the person in respect of whose default the guarantee is given is called the “principal de btor”, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called the “creditor ”.A guarantee may be either oral or written.127.Consideration for guarantee .—Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the principal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the s urety for giving the guarantee.Illustrations (a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit.A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the price of the goods.C promises to guarantee the payment in cons ideration of A ’s promise to deliver the goods.This is a sufficient consideration for C ’s promise.
(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if he does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B.A agrees to forbear as requested.This is a sufficient consideration for C’s promise.(c) A sells and delivers goods to B.C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in defau lt of B.The agreement is void.35 128.Surety ’s liability .—The liability of the surety is co - extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by t he contract.Illustration A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor.The bill is dishonoured by C.A is liable , not only for the amount of the bill , but also for any interest and charges w hich may have become due on it.129.“Continuing guarantee ”.—A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions , is called a “continuing guarantee ”.
Illustrations (a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B ’s zamindari, promises B to be responsible, to the amount of 5,000 rupees, for the due collection and payment by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee.(b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea -dealer, to the amount of £100, for any tea he may from time to time supply to C.B supplies C with tea to above the value of £100, and C pays B for it.Afterwards , B supplies C with tea to the value of £200.C fails to pa y.The guarantee given by A was a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the exten t of £100.(c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C and to be paid for in a month.B delivers five sack s to C.C pays for them.Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does riot pay for.The guarantee given by A was not a continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable f or the price of the four sacks.
130.Revo cation of continuing guarantee .—A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by the surety, as to future transacti ons, by notice to the creditor. Illustrations (a) A, in consideration of B ’s discounting, at A ’s request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the due payment of all such bills to the extent of 5,000 rupees.B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 rupees.Afterward s, at the end of three months, A revokes the guarantee.This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent dis count.But A is liable to B for the 2,000 rupees, on d efault of C.(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him.B draws upon C.C accepts the bill.A gives notice of revocation.C dishono urs the bill at maturity.A is liable upon his guarant ee.
131.Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety ’s death .—The death of the surety operates, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regar ds future transactions. 132.Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected by arrangement between them that one shall be surety on other ’s default .—Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a certain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable only on the default of the other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to the third person under the first contract is not affected by the e xistence of the second contract, although such third person may ha ve been aware of its existence.Illustration A and B make a joint and several promissory note to C.A makes it, in fact, as surety for B, and C knows this at the time when the note is made.
The fact that A, to the knowledge of C, made the note as surety for B, is no answer to a suit by C against A upon the note . 133.Discharge of surety by variance in terms of contract .—Any variance, made without the surety ’s consent, in the terms of the contract between the principal 1[debtor] and the creditor, discharges the surety as to transacti ons subsequent to the variance.Illustrations (a) A becomes surety to C for B ’s conduct as a manager in C ’s bank.Afterwards, B and C contract, without A ’s consent, that B ’s salary shall be raised, and that he shall become liable for one -fourth of the losses on overdrafts.B allows a customer to 1.Ins.by Act 24 of 1917, s.2 and the first Schedule .36 overdraw, and the bank loses a sum of money.A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance made without his c onsent, and is not liable to make good this loss.
(b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C, and of which the duties are defined by an Act of the Legislature. By a subsequent Act, the nature of the office is m aterially altered.Afterwards, B misconducts himself.A is discharged by the change from future liability under his guarantee, though the misco nduct of B is in respect of a duty not affected by the later Act.(c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A ’s becoming surety to C for B ’s duly accounting for moneys received by him as such clerk.Afterwards, without A ’s knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid by a commission on the goods sold by him and not by a fixed salary.A is not liable for subsequent misconduct of B.(d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3,000 rupees for any oil supplied by C to B on credit.
Afterwards B becomes embarrassed, and, without the knowledge of A, B and C contr act that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready money, and that the paymen ts shall be applied to the then, existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on his guarantee for any goods suppli ed after : this new arrangement.(e) C contracts to lend B 5,000 rupees on the 1st March.A guarantees repayment.C pays the 5,000 rupees to B on the 1st January.A is discharged from his liability, as the contract has been varied, inasmuch as C might sue B for the money before the 1st of March.134.Discharge o f surety by release or discharge of principal debtor .—The surety is discharged by any contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released , or by any act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the dis charge of the principal debtor.Illustrations (a) A gives a guarantee to C for goods to be supplied by C to B.
C supplies goods to B, and afterwards B becomes embarrassed and contracts with his creditors (including C) to assign to them his property in consideration of their releasing him from their demands. Here B is released from his debt by the contract with C, and A is discharged from his suretyship.(b) A contracts w ith B to grow a crop of indigo o n A’s land and to deliver it to B at a fixed rate, and C guarantees A ’s performance of this contract.B diverts a stream of water which is necessary for the irrigation of A ’s land and thereby prevents him from raising the indigo.C is no longer liable on his guarantee.(c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B supplying the necessary timber.C guarantees A ’s performance of the contract.B omits to supply the timber.C is discharged from his suretyship .135.
Discharge of surety when creditor compounds with, gives time to, or agree s not to sue, principal debtor .—A contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes a composition with, or promises to give time to, or not to sue, the principal debtor, discharges the surety, unless the s urety assents to such contract. 136.Surety not discharged when agreement made with third person to give time to pri ncipal debtor .—Where a contract to give time to the principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third person, and not with the principal debtor , the surety is not discharged.Illustration C, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as suret y for B, and accepted by B, contracts with M to give time to B.A is not discharged.137.
Creditor ’s forbearance to sue does not discharge surety .—Mere forbearance on the part of the creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any other remedy against him does not, in the absence of any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety. Illustration B owes to C a debt guaranteed by A.The debt becomes payable.C does not sue B for a year after the debt has become payable.A is not discharged from his suretyship.37 138.Release of one co -surety does not discharge others .—Where there are co -sureties, a release by the creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released from his respons ibility to the other sureties1.139.
Discharge of surety by creditor ’s act or omission impairing surety ’s eventual remedy .—If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the principal debtor is thereby impa ired, the surety is discharged. Illustrations (a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work reaches certain stages.A becomes surety to C for B ’s due performance of the contract.C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments.A is discharged by this prepayment.(b) C lends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note made in C ’s favour by B, and by A as surety for B, together with a bill of sale of B ’s furniture, which gives power to C to sell the furniture, and apply the proceeds in discharge of the note.
Subsequently, C sells the furniture, but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a small price is realized. A is dischar ged from liability on the note.(c) A puts M as apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M ’s fidelity.B promises on his part that he will, at least once a month, see M make up the cash.B omits to see this done as promised, and M embezzles.A is no t liable to B on his guarantee.140.Rights of su rety on payment or performance .—Where a guaranteed debt has become due, or default of the principal debtor to perform a guaranteed du ty has taken place, the surety upon payment or performance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor ha d against the principal debtor.
141.Surety ’s right to benefit of creditor ’s securities .—A surety is entitled to the benefit of every security which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship is entered into, w hether the surety knows of the ex istence of such security or not ; and if the creditor loses, or, without the consent of the surety, parts with such security, the surety is discharged to the exten t of the value of the security. Illustrations (a)C, advances to B, his tenant, 2,000 rupees on the guarantee of A.C has also a further security for the 2,000 rupees by a mortgage of B ’s furniture.C cancels the mortgage.B becomes insolvent and C sues A on his guarantee.A is discharged from liability to the amount of the value of the furniture.(b)C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for that advance from A.
C afterwards takes B ’s goods in execution under the decree, and then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution.

231.Rights of parties to a contrac t made by agent not disclosed .—If an agent makes a contract with a person who neither knows, nor has reason to suspect, that he is an agent, his principal may require the performance of the contract ; but the other contracting party has, as against the principal, the same rights as he would have had as against the agent i f the agent had been principal. If the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other contracting party may refuse to fulfil the contract, if he can show th at, if he had known who was the principal in the contract, or if he had known that the agent was not a principal, he would not have entered into the contract.51 232.
Performance of contract with a gent supposed to be principal .—Where one man makes a contract with another, neither knowing nor having reasonable ground to suspect that the other is an agent, the principal, if he requires the performance of the contract, can only obtain such performance subject to the rights and obligations subsisting between the a gent and t he other party to the contract. Illustration A, who owes 500 rupees to B, sells 1,000 rupees worth of rice to B.A is acting as agent for C i n the transaction, but B has no knowledge nor reasonable ground of suspicion that such is the case.C cannot compel B to take the rice without allowing him to set -off A ’s debt.233.Right of person dealin g with agent personally liable .—In cases where the agent is personally liable, a person dealing with him may hold either him or his prin cipal, or both of t hem, liable.

236.Person falsely contracting as a gent not entitled to performance .—A person with whom a contract has been entered into in the character of agent, is not entitled to require the performance of it, if he was in reality acting, not as agent, but on his own account. 237.Liability of principal induc ing belief that agent ’s unauthoriz ed acts were authorized .— When an agent has, without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to third persons on behalf of his principal, the principal is bound by such acts or obligations, if he has by his words or conduct induced such third persons to believe that such acts and obligations were within the scope of the agent ’s authority.Illustrations (a) A consig ns goods to B for sale, and gives him instructions not to sell under a fixed price.C, being ignorant of B ’s instructions, enters into a contract with B to buy the goods at a price lower than the reserved pri ce.A is bound by the contract.
(b) A entrusts B with negotiable instruments endorsed in blank. B sells them to C in violation of private orders from A.The sale is good.238.Effect , on agreement, of misrep resentation of fraud, by agent .—Misrepresentation made, or frauds committed, by agents acting in the course of their business for their principals, have the same effect on agreements made by such agents as if such misrepresentations or frauds had been made or committed by the principals; but misrepresentations made, or frauds committed, by agents, in matters which do not fall within their authority, do not affect their prin cipals.Illustrations (a) A, being B ’s agent for the sale of goods, induces C to buy them by a misrepresentation, which he w as not authorized by B to make.The contract is voidable, as betwe en B and C, at the option of C.(b) A, the captain of B ’s ship, signs bills of lading without having received on board the goods mentioned therein.

Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm .— Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge t hat it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good f aith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.

Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matte r of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conf lagration from spreading.
He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.

Illustration A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement.This agreem ent implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play ; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.88.
Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit .— Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm whi ch it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any per son for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.

Illustration Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of sa ving the life of the woman) is an offence independ ently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman.Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm ”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causin g of such miscarriage does not justify the act.27 92.
Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent .—Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for tha t person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person i n lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provi ded— Provisos .

Abetment of a thing .—A person abets the doing of a thing, who — First .—Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly .—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of th at thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and i n order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly .—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. Explanation 1 .—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.Illustration A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Just ice to apprehend Z.B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally c auses A to apprehend C.Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.
Explanation 2 .—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates t he commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. 108.Abettor .—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.Explanation 1 .—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence alth ough the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.Explanation 2 .—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abett ed should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.Illustrations (a) A instigates B to murder C.B refuses to do so.A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.(b) A instigates B to murder D.
B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recov ers from the wound.A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.Explanation 3 .—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of t he abettor or any guilty intention or knowledge.31 Illustrations (a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having th e same intention as A.Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death.B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence o f A and thereby causes Z's death.
Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. (c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house.B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation.B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession.A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A.B takes the prope rty out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property.
B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.Explanation 4 .—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence.Illustration A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z.B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation.B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.Explanation 5 .—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.It is sufficien t if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.Illustration A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z.
It is agreed that A shall a dminister the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name.C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained.A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence.Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.C has therefore committed the offence define d in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.1[108A.Abetment in India of offences outside India .—A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India].Illustration A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa , A is guilty of abetting murder.] 109.
Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment .—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for th e punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. Explanation .—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or w ith the aid which constitutes the abetment.Illustrations (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions.B accepts the bribe.A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.1.Added by Act 4 of 1898, s.3.2.The words “British India” have successively been subs.by the A.O.1 948, the A.O.1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s.3 and the Sch., to read as above.
32 (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the in stigation, commits that offence.A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.(c) A and B conspire to poison Z.A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z.B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A ’s absence and thereby causes Z ’s death.Here B is guilty of murder.A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.110.
Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intentio n from that of abettor .—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 111.Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done .—When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it: Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.Illustrations (a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose.
The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the c ircumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated t he child to put the poison into the food of Y.(b) A instigates B to burn Z ’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there.A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of ab etting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probabl e consequence of the burning.(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight fo r the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose.B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z.
Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishme nt provided for murder. 112.Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done .—If the act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is commit ted in addition to the act abetted, and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.Illustration A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant.B, in consequence resists that distress.In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the d istress.As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences.113.
Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different fro m that intended by the abettor. —When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect cause d, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.Illustration A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z.B, in consequence of the instig ation, causes grievous hurt to Z.Z dies in consequence.Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.114.
Abettor present when offence is committed .—Whenever any person who is absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 33 115.
Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life —if offence not committed .—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, an d no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of eith er description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; if act causing harm be done in consequence .—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable t o imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen y ears, and shall also be liable to fine. Illustration A instigates B to murder Z.The offence is not committed.If B had mu rdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment of death or 1[imprisonment for life].
Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a ter m which may extend to seven years and also to a fine, and if any hurt be done to Z in co nsequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a ter m which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. 116.Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment —if offence be not committed.

CHAPTER XVI OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY Of offences affecting life 299.Culpable homicide .—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cau se death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.Illustrations (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby cau sing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused.
Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush.B does not know it.A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush.B fires and kills Z.Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, w ho is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there.Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty o f culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death .Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have c aused his death.1.Ins.by Act 25 of 1927, s.2.2.Subs.by the A.O.

Murder .—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or — 2ndly .—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offende r knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or — 3rdly .—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or — 4thly .—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous t hat it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and comm its such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. Illustrations (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him.Z dies in consequence.A commits murder.
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow.A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a p erson in a sound state of health.But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death .(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.Z dies in consequence.Here A is guilty of murder, although he ma y not have intended to cause Z's death.
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular i ndividual.Exception 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.The above exception is subject to the following provisos: — First .—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for killing or doing harm to any person.Secondly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.Thirdly .—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation .—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child.This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A.A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.A kills Z.Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.74 (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff.A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z.This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a publi c servant in the exercise of his powers.(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate.
Z says that he does no t believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.This is murder.(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose.Z, in the exercise of the right of p rivate defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so.A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, an d kills Z.This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defe nce.(f) Z strikes B.B is by this provocation excited to violent rage.A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose.B kills Z with the knife.Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.
Exception 2 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A.A draws out a pistol.Z persists in the assault.A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead.A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.
Exception 3 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is caused. Exception 4 .—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.Explanation .—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.Exception 5 .—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.
Illustration A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has there fore abetted murder.301.Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was intended .—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to ca use death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender i s of the description of which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or k new himself to be likely to cause.302.Punishment for murder .—Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death, or 1[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine.303.

(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such previous conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a di fferent kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.

Illustrations (a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place.The charg e need not set out the manner in which the theft was effected.(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place.The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.(c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place.The char ge must set out that portion of the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place.The charge must set out the manner in which A obs tructed B in the discharge of his functions.

Illustrations (a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), w ith “having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit ,” the word “fraudulently ” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission , the error shall not be regarded as material.(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out incorrectly.A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction.T he Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge.There were many 109 transactions between A and B, and A h ad no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence.
The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error. (d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda B aksh on the 21st January, 1882.In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882.A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclus ively to the case of Haidar Baksh.The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest hi m for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882.When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh.The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh.The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.216.

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.(3) If the alte ration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to pr ejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded. 217.Recall of witnesses when c harge altered.—Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed — (a) to recall or re -summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re -examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice; (b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.B.—Joinder of charges 218.
